# Smart CLI-Based Library Management System (LMS)

A command-line based Python application that simulates how a real-world library operates.  
The system allows administrators to manage books, issue and return them, calculate fines, and store data persistently using files. \This project focuses on **clean logic, modular design, and practical Python fundamentals** rather than external frameworks.

## Features

- Add, update, and remove books
- Issue and return books with automatic fine calculation
- Due date tracking with overdue detection
- CLI-based return reminders for pending and overdue books
- User management with book issuing limits
- Search and filter books by title, author, or status
- View transaction history and reports
- Persistent storage using CSV or JSON files
- Robust input validation and error handling

## Concepts & Skills Used

- Functions and modular programming
- Dictionaries and loops
- File handling using CSV and JSON
- Conditional logic
- Exception handling
- Clean and readable code structure

## Data Storage

- Book records and transaction data are stored locally
- Supports **CSV** or **JSON** file formats
- Ensures data persistence even after program termination

## How to Run the Project

1. Ensure **Python 3** is installed on your system
2. Clone the repository
3. Run the application: `python main.py`
